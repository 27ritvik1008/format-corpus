format-corpus
=============

An openly-licensed corpus of small example files, covering a wide range of formats and creation tools.

Each folder contains a set of related test files that are related or otherwise managed together. The idea is that each of these would include metadata associated with the files, and an additional process will be written that analyses all the files and builds a set of web pages that cross-reference the content and allow deeper exploration. i.e. a map or atlas.

Atlas Axes:
* Formats, e.g. fmt/application/pdf/version=1.4
* Software, e.g. sfw/OSX/OpenOffice3.2
* Visualisations, etc.


How to Contribute
=================

In short, the process is:

 * Set up Git
   * As per https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
   * Consider using the native client, as this lets you manage a repository without using the command line.
 * Fork this repository 
   * As per https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
 * Use your Git client to add and commit your files, including useful metadata and a commit message.
 * Use your Git client to push the changes to GitHub.
 * Submit a pull request and we'll pull it in.

Hm, I fear this is too complex. Can we use SparkleShare or Dropbox or something to make things simpler?
