format-corpus
=============

An openly-licensed corpus of small example files, covering a wide range of formats and creation tools.

Each folder contains a set of related test files that are related or otherwise managed together. The idea is that each of these would include metadata associated with the files, and an additional process will be written that analyses all the files and builds a set of web pages that cross-reference the content and allow deeper exploration. i.e. a map or atlas.

Atlas Axes:
* Formats, e.g. fmt/application/pdf/version=1.4
* Software, e.g. sfw/OSX/OpenOffice3.2
* Visualisations, etc.
