# The Archivist's PDF Cabinet of Horrors 


## About these files
Test *PDF* files, created for detecting *PDF* features that are undesired in archival settings. Most of these files were originally created in Microsoft Word 2003, and then converted to *PDF* with Adobe Acrobat Professional 9.5.2. The source Word files are included here as well, but in many cases the *PDFs* required further processing in Acrobat (e.g. embedding videos, attaching files, encryption) so they're probably not that useful.

Exceptions are:

*javascript.pdf*, which was created with Didier Stevens' *make-pdf* tool, which is available here: [http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/](http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/)

*digitally_signed_3D_Portfolio.pdf*, which was kindly provided by Adobe.
